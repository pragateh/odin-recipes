        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>Hamburger, also called burger, ground beef. The term is applied variously to (1) a patty of ground beef, sometimes called hamburg steak, Salisbury steak, or Vienna steak, (2) a sandwich consisting of a patty of ground beef served within a split bread roll, with various garnishes, or (3) the ground beef itself, which is used as a base in many sauces, casseroles, terrines, and the like.</p>
        <p>The origin of hamburger is unknown, but the hamburger patty and sandwich were probably brought by 19th-century German immigrants to the United States, where in a matter of decades the hamburger came to be considered an archetypal American food. The importance of the hamburger in American popular culture is indicated by its virtual ubiquity at backyard barbecues and on fast-food restaurant menus and by the proliferation of so-called hamburger stands and restaurants. Some chains, such as McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s, proliferated worldwide.</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
            <li>8 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon steak seasoning</li>
            <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 large lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>½ red onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Butter each half of hamburger buns.
            </li>
            <li>Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Set the skillet aside, reserving grease.
            </li>
            <li>Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning together in a large bowl; do not overmix. Form into 4 patties. Make a thumbprint in the middle of each patty to keep it from shrinking as it cooks.
            </li>
            <li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until preferred doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Top each burger with 2 slices bacon and a Cheddar cheese slice; close the grill lid until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Remove patties from the grill.
            </li>
            <li>Place buns on the grill, buttered-side down, and cook until browned, about 1 minute. Remove from the grill. Place 1 patty on the bottom half of each bun.
            </li>
            <li>Reheat the bacon grease in the skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into the hot skillet and fry until whites are cooked but yolk is still runny, about 4 minutes. Immediately place 1 egg on top of each patty. Top with lettuce, onion, avocado, and remaining buns.
            </li>
        </ol>
